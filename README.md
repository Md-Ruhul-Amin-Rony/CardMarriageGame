## 🎓 Strategy Tips & Best Practices

### Bidding Strategy
- **Conservative Approach:** Only bid if you have strong high-value cards (J, 9, A, 10)
- **Trump Potential:** Bid higher if you have multiple cards of one suit (potential trump)
- **Marriage Power:** Bid aggressively if you have K+Q of a suit
- **Position Matters:** Last bidder has advantage (knows all other bids)
- **Minimum Risk:** Pass early if your hand is weak (< 3 point cards)

### Trump Selection
- **Strong Suit:** Choose suit where you have J, 9, or marriage (K+Q)
- **7a Option:** Use when unsure or to add unpredictability
- **Card Count:** Prefer suit with 4+ cards for better control
- **Avoid Weak Suits:** Don't choose trump if you only have low cards (7, 8)

### Double Challenge Decision
- **Accept Double When:**
  - Contractor's bid is high (23+) and you have strong cards
  - You have trump marriage in multiple suits
  - Contractor seems inexperienced
- **Decline Double When:**
  - Contractor's bid is conservative (16-18)
  - Your hand is weak
  - Risk/reward ratio is poor

### Playing Strategy
- **Lead Strong:** When leading, play high-value cards to win tricks
- **Trump Timing:** Save trump cards for crucial tricks
- **Ask for Trump Carefully:** Only ask when you're CERTAIN you have no lead suit cards (foul = instant loss!)
- **Track Cards:** Remember which cards have been played
- **Team Communication:** Use chat to coordinate (within game rules)
- **Marriage Reveal:** Play K or Q of trump to signal marriage to partner

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ **Foul Risk:** Never ask for trump if you have even one lead suit card
- ❌ **Overbidding:** Don't bid too high with weak hands
- ❌ **Trump Waste:** Don't use trump on low-value tricks
- ❌ **Early Pass:** Don't pass too quickly in bidding if you have decent cards
- ❌ **Ignoring Marriage:** Always check for K+Q combinations when choosing trump

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Gameplay Questions

**Q: Can I play with only 2 or 3 players?**  
A: No, the game requires exactly 4 players to start. This is a core rule of the 29 card game.

**Q: What happens if someone disconnects during the game?**  
A: The game state is preserved. The disconnected player can rejoin using the same name. However, if the server restarts, all game data is lost.

**Q: Can I see the trump suit before it's revealed?**  
A: Only the contractor can see the trump suit initially. Others see it when someone successfully "Asks for Trump."

**Q: What is the "7a" option?**  
A: Instead of choosing a specific suit, the contractor can let the 7th card in the deck determine the trump. This adds randomness and excitement!

**Q: How does the double challenge work?**  
A: After bidding, the opposing team can choose to double the stakes. If they accept, the winner of that round gets +2 rounds instead of +1 (and loser loses -2).

**Q: What happens if I ask for trump but have cards of the lead suit?**  
A: This is called a FOUL. The opposing team instantly wins the round. Be very careful!

**Q: Can both teams have trump marriage?**  
A: Yes! If the opposing team has K+Q of trump, the contractor needs to score 4 additional points (Bid + 4) to win the round.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Do I need to create an account?**  
A: No, the game is completely anonymous. Just enter a name and start playing!

**Q: Can I play on mobile?**  
A: Yes! The UI is fully responsive and works great on phones and tablets.

**Q: Is there a time limit for turns?**  
A: Currently no, but this is on the roadmap for future updates.

**Q: Can spectators watch the game?**  
A: Not yet, but spectator mode is planned for a future release.

**Q: How many games can run simultaneously?**  
A: The server can handle around 100+ concurrent rooms depending on resources.

**Q: Is my game data saved?**  
A: No, all game state is in-memory and resets when the server restarts. Database persistence is planned.

## 🐛 Known Issues & Roadmap

### Current Limitations
- In-memory state (resets on server restart - no persistence)
- Single server only (no horizontal scaling due to in-memory state)
- No authentication (anonymous gameplay only)
- No game history or replay functionality

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Persistent storage (MongoDB/Redis for game state)
- [ ] User authentication and profiles
- [ ] Game history and statistics tracking
- [ ] Spectator mode (watch games without playing)
- [ ] AI opponents for practice mode
- [ ] Sound effects and enhanced animations
- [ ] Multiple language support (i18n)
- [ ] Tournament brackets system
- [ ] Global leaderboards and player rankings
- [ ] Private rooms with password protection
- [ ] Mobile native apps (iOS/Android)
- [ ] Card dealing animations
- [ ] Undo last card (with team agreement)
- [ ] Time limits for turns
- [ ] Emoji reactions during gameplay

## 🎯 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Connection Failed**
- Check if server is running on correct port (default: 5000)
- Ensure firewall allows the port
- Try refreshing the page

**Room Full Error**
- Maximum 4 players per room
- Create a new room or wait for players to leave

**Cards Not Showing**
- Clear browser cache and refresh
- Check console for JavaScript errors
- Ensure SignalR connection is established

**Trump Not Revealing**
- Trump only reveals when someone "Asks for Trump" correctly
- Player must have no cards of lead suit to ask
- Asking with lead suit cards = FOUL (opponent wins round)

**Reconnection Not Working**
- Use exact same player name when rejoining
- Room must still exist (not cleared)
- Connection ID will be updated automatically

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Current Implementation
- No authentication (suitable for casual play)
- Room IDs are public (anyone can join with ID)
- No rate limiting on API calls
- In-memory state prevents data breaches

### Production Recommendations
- Implement JWT authentication
- Add rate limiting middleware
- Use HTTPS in production
- Validate all user inputs on server-side
- Implement CORS policies
- Add logging and monitoring
- Use environment variables for sensitive config

---

## 📊 Performance Optimization

### Current Performance
- WebSocket connections for low latency
- Minimal database overhead (in-memory)
- Client-side card sorting and rendering
- Personalized state reduces data transfer

### Scaling Considerations
- Current: Single server supports ~100 concurrent rooms
- For scaling: Consider Redis for shared state
- SignalR backplane for multi-server deployment
- CDN for static assets
- Implement connection pooling
